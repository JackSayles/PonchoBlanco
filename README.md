# Poncho Blanco
#### So where did the nic name 'Poncho Blanco' come from?

In the summer of 2017 I did a half solo half run with a friend on the Appalachian Trail through the Great Smoky Mountain National Park, otherwise called the SCAR - Smokies Challange Adventure Run. During this run I ended up having to use a white poncho that I had purchased the morning of the run due to some thunderstorms that had rolled in in the middle of the day.

A trail running site for trail runners needing resources and tips as well as a place for those who might be interested in trail running.
