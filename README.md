## Poncho Blanco

I'm attempting to build a website/blog that will be a resourse for interested people.

The biggest hangup I'm having at this point is figuring out how to get pictures I've uploaded to my repository to show up on my website. My code is correct and I'm being told my images have to be hosted somewhere.
