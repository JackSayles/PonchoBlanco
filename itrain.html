        <h3>How I Train</h3>
        <p>The way I train now has progressed from when I first started trail running. In the beginning I wasn't concerned with stretching nor working on my 'core'. Heck, I didn't even know I had a core. My how times have changed. I would encourage everyone no matter how young or old, new or veteran to trails to have some sort of stretching and strengthening routine.</p>
        <p>There are two areas of focus in my training these days. First is in keeping my legs flexible, second is in keeping my core strong. When I started hearing about the 'core' and working on it, I didn't think much of it until this story came to me. A friend of mine is a beast of a long distance road runner, running 24 hours around a high school track. Yes, this was a race. He was telling me that as he neared the end he couldn't keep his upper body upright. When I asked him why his reply was that his core wasn't strong enough to keep his body in the right form. His legs could kind of move, but nothing like when he could keep his trunk upright. Can you imagine trying to run while bent at a 90 degree angle? Yea, me either. So I started to work on my core.</p>
