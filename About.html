      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>My trail name is Poncho Blanco, but my name is Jack. In the Adventure Runs section you will find out how I received that nick name. In 2012 I started trail running, in the years since many thing about my running have evolved, everything from how I train to nutrition to distances. Most of my runs take place in the Nashville area. <br /><br /></p>
      <h4>My local trails:</h4>
      <p><strong>Warner Parks</strong>, my main training area. This park has four main sections three of which are loops and one is a point to point. The Warner Woods Trail, aka ‘The White Trail’ which is a 2.5 mile loop; the Mossy Ridge Trail, aka ‘The Red Trail’ which is a 4.5 mile loop; the Harpeth Woods Trail aka ‘The Blue Trail’ which is another 2.5 mile loop; then there is the Candy Cane which is a 1 mile point to point trail connecting the ‘Red Trail’ to the ‘Blue Trail’.<br/>
        <strong>Long Hunter State Park</strong>, which has two trails that I run on. The Volunteer Trail is 4.5 mile one way out and back, which is very rocky and technical. The other is the Bryant Cove trail another 4 mile one way out and back.<br/>
      <strong>Smith Park</strong> has a series of color coded trails which combine for an over distance of 3 to 4 miles, they can be arranged such that you can get many more miles than that. This park is great for hill repeat workouts.<br/></p>
      <h4>My trail history:</h4>
      <p>When I started out I trained for a 9 mile trail run called ‘The Wild Thang’ here in the Nashville area. When it came to race day I thought that race was the hardest thing I had ever done. My wife and I had started hanging out with a Fleet Feet Brentwood group on Thursday evenings in the summer of 2012 called the Summer Mixer. My wife wanted something we could do together, which for me wasn’t going to involve road running. So she suggested trail running. I love being out in the woods hiking and camping but had never considered running on those trails. After a week or two I was hooked. At that point in time I could barely manage 2 ½ miles once a week, it took everything I had to go that far. As that summer came to a close my wife suggested we sign up for a training program and run a race together. As I began to read the requirements for the training program I was really nervous. I read that I needed to be able to run for 5 miles, I’d never gone that far before. So I talked with the Fleet Feet coaches that would be doing the training and they assured me that I would do fine. When I finally ran the Red Trail for the first time I seriously wondered what I had gotten myself into, about 2/3’s of the way through and on the who knows how many climbs since I had started I think I stopped and cried because I was so exhausted and I had no idea how much longer I had to go and I wasn’t sure that I could finish the loop. Obviously I finished the loop and these many years later I still can’t believe how far I’ve come since I began.<br/>
      About 3 years ago our local Fleet Feet opened its second location and during their soft opening that told us we could go write on a chalk board toward the back of the store what we wanted to accomplish with our running. I had just learned that several of my friends/mentors where signing up for 100 milers, so I wrote that within 5 years I hope to run my first 100 miler. My wife thought I was nuts. I’m hoping by the end of 2018 to have done my first 100 mile race.<br/>
      The trails between 2012 and now have taken me out west and kept me in the southeast. A friend, Jobie, threw out this statement to several of us newbies a few years back “I like to run each distance at least 3 times before moving up.” For some reason that just seemed to ring true with me and I have followed that piece of advice. By the time I had run a 50k, 31 miles, race I had covered the distances between 10 to 20 miles at least five or more times. By the time I did my first 50 mile race I had at least 4 races at the 50k distance and at least 3 adventure runs at the 50k distance.  When I started looking at the 100k distance, 62 miles, I had done 50 miles several times either as races or adventure runs.<br/>
      One of the biggest things I’ve learned about trail races and myself is that I need to come close to doing the targeted race distance on my own before doing it for a race. It is truly a mental thing helping me to know that I can go the distance, even if it takes me longer on my own than it will for the race.</p>
