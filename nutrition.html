        <h2>Nutrition</h2><br/>
          <p>I get asked questions about nutrition all the time. It is probably the most frequent question I'm asked.<br />
I tell them  real food is best for me. I use to tell people to try different types of foods out and use work best for them, but that has changed big time. Eat foods as close to what you normally eat every day, this will reduce greatly stomach upsets. I know you can't carry those foods with you with out some serious issues, but you can get real close with a few small adjustments.<br/>
I eat every 30 minutes on races at or under 50 miles or taking less than 13 hours. On runs that I know will take me longer after about 15 hours I start eating every 15 minutes in smaller portions. I have found this way helps me keep food in and causes less stomach distress.
There are three prepackaged foods I take with me Spring Energy tops this list followed by Tanka Jerky, they have both a sweet and spicy versions, then oatmeal cookies from Great Harvest. For liquids I rely mostly on water, but for electrolites I have found both Spring Energy's Elec+roRide and Tailwind at half strenght work well. I love the mint in Spring Energy's Elec+roRide!<br/>
To go with these I also make bullet burittos which are refried beans mixed with white rice, which is all of Spring Energy's foods. I flavor mine with Italian seasonings. I put this mixture in small flatout foldables, which I then fry in butter. I have found that if I don't fry them the bread gets really soft and mushy, which for me makes them nasty.<br/>
So, don't try whatever. Stick to as close to as to what you normally eat and make it real food.</p>
