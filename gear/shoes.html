        <p>My biggest piece of advice here is two-fold. First get fitted for shoes, just like you would a nice dress or suit do the same for your feet. I'm not talking about getting a custom made pair of shoes, but you walk in a certain way so get shoes that work with the way you walk. Get a pair of shoes similar to the foot wear you wear every day. Most shoes have some sort of drop in height from the heal to the toe, it's called the heal-to-toe drop. Get a trail shoe close to that drop. Now this doesn't work if your in heals all day or you wear cowboy boots all the time, yes I use to wear cowboy boots all the time. If that's the case then get a comfortable shoe with the highest heal-to-toe drop you can find, it is really important that both of these conditions are true. Oh, and one more thing. We run through a lot of streams, creeks and narrow rivers we run over slick rocks. So find a shoe that is sticky, my personal favorite as far as sticky treads go is a Vibram sole. I have never worried about any slick rocks or water crossings in a Vibram soled shoe.<br/>There are a lot of different brands of trail shoes, the most noted are Nike, Solomon and Hoka One One and these brands are the ones I would recommend trying first. I currently run in the Nike Wild Horse 4 and have run in the past 3 versions of the shoe, they are very responsive, drain well, and don't tighten up over a long run. I have run several 50 mile distances and longer in these shoes and only have a problem when the shoe has over 500 miles on them. The recommendation for your current running shoe is to replace them every 300 miles; that can get expensive when you cover a lot of miles. So I go with two boundaries one is when the shoe starts to fall apart and the other is when on a long run, longer than 30 miles, my feet and back start to hurt I know at that point it is time for new shoes.</p>
