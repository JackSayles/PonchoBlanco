        <h4>My local trails:</h4>
        <p><strong>Warner Parks</strong>, my main training area. This park has four main sections three of which are loops and one is a point to point. The Warner Woods Trail, aka ‘The White Trail’ which is a 2.5 mile loop; the Mossy Ridge Trail, aka ‘The Red Trail’ which is a 4.5 mile loop; the Harpeth Woods Trail aka ‘The Blue Trail’ which is another 2.5 mile loop; then there is the Candy Cane which is a 1 mile point to point trail connecting the ‘Red Trail’ to the ‘Blue Trail’.<br/>
        <strong>Long Hunter State Park</strong>, which has two trails that I run on. The Volunteer Trail is 4.5 mile one way out and back, which is very rocky and technical. The other is the Bryant Cove trail another 4 mile one way out and back.<br/>
        <strong>Smith Park</strong> has a series of color coded trails which combine for an over distance of 3 to 4 miles, they can be arranged such that you can get many more miles than that. This park is great for hill repeat workouts.<br/></p>
