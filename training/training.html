          <h1>Keys To Training</h1>
          <h4>Train for the race you are going to run!</h4>          
          <p>Getting ready for the distance - There are a several different ideas here, one is at least a month or more out from your race you have covered the distance. The other is where you estimate the amount of time it will take you to finish the race and complete about 60% to 75% of that time once or twice with the last time being about 3 weeks before your race. Last is the idea that you cover about 70% of your race mileage in a week in your peak weeks before your race, this is usually weeks 5 to 3 prior to your race. While all of these have their advantages and disadvantages, I usually do some combination of the first and last.<br/></p>
          <p>Cross Training - I use to not think a lot about this idea and didn't think I was doing it until I had a deformity show up in my heal. I have been doing aerobic and body weight bearing workouts for years, this is a part of cross training. There is another key in cross training, which is doing another activity that takes the stress of impact off your feet while still conditioning your body to endure the miles that will come. Over the summers when I have access to water, swimming is one of those cross training activites. For me the most dependable is a bike with its back tire in a trainer. I just get on and pick a gear that is hard enough to give me a work out, but I can still go for a couple of hours with out stopping.<br/></p>
          <p>Elevation Profies - This is one of the most neglected topics for folks just starting out in trail running. Early on when I was just starting to run on trails the idea of elevation profiles had never come up, so I had no idea what it was nor how to use the information. Basically an elevation profile gives you an idea of how many ups and downs your going to have and how steep they could be along with some sort of note about overall gain or climb, sometimes race directors combine both the gain and loss so as to give a bigger number making the race seem harder. Being able to tailor your training to look like the races elevation profile is a great way to train for your races.<br/></p>
          <p>Aid Stations - These are often over looking in preparing for a race, but reading the information the race director puts out about how far a part the aid stations will be along with what the aid stations will have to eat and drink can make a huge difference in how you plan your race. It affects what you carry with you and how much you carry at any one time.<br/></p>
