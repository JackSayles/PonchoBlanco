      <h1>HILLS!!!</h1>
      <p> I have found that hills are one of the most elusive aspects of trail running to master. At one point I use to think I was really good at navigating the ups and downs such that I stopped thinking about how I go up and down; this coupled with a huge winter storm one year that left the trails all iced up really set back my hill smarts.</p>    
      <p>Now I've gotten some of that skill back. How? Well by one key thing. Smaller steps! I watched a video a few years ago of Zack Miller racing The North Face Endurance Challenge San Francisco the same year I did that race. He was going down the hills and his feet were moving so fast that it looked like Gregory Hines doing a tap dance routine. So, I started practicing those types of steps. I couldn't believe how much that helped! Now I use this concept going both up and down the hills. Going up hills it really helps with the shorter and less steep grades. The longer and steeper ones I still just power hike up. Going down those quick steps really help to do two things get down quicker and give greater control over the descent.</p>  
      <p><strong>Hills are speed work in disguise</strong></p>
      <p>One thing I seem to never forget about hill work has been that it helps me go faster on flatter sections. I could be wrong and I don't have any proof to back this up, but the quicker foot steps are is what really helps with the speed on the more even sections of the trails.</p>
      <p>For me hill work starts with finding the longest hill I can find. My favorites are up and over as opposed to the top and back down. I've read in many places that you only should do hill work for about 20 or 30 minutes at a time, but that didn't compute with my mindset. In nearly every single race longer than 10 miles I've always had situations where my climb took me 20 minutes or longer to get to the top. One hill was so steep that I didn't think my F350 could get up it even though the length of the hill was only about 3/4 of a mile long. What I do is this: after selecting the hill I move as quickly and efficiently as possible up the hill, if the climb has a flat section or a very gentile climb the for that section I try a bit of a run, not real fast but faster than a power hike. Once at the top and head down I use those quick steps to increase my speed while keeping control of my body on the descent. I use two methods to determine when the workout is over one is the amount of time I've spent going up and down the other is the amount of miles I've covered. Depending on the race this could be as little as one hour and 5 miles on up. The longest had been 13 miles and almost 3 hours, that race had a lot of gain.</p>
