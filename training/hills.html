    <h1>HILLS!!!</h1>
    <p> I have found that hills are one of the most elusive aspects of trail running to master. At one point I use to think I was really good at navigating the ups and downs such that I stopped thinking about how I go up and down; this coupled with a huge winter storm one year that left the trails all iced up really set back my hill smarts.</p>
    <p>Now I've gotten some of that skill back. How? Well by one key thing. Smaller steps! I watched a video a few years ago of Zack Miller racing The North Face Endurance Challenge the same year I did that race. He was going down the hills and his feet were moving so fast that it looked like Gregory Hines doing a tap dance routine. So, I started practicing those types of steps. I couldn't believe how much that helped! Now I use this concept going both up and down the hills. Going up hills it really helps with the shorter and less steep grades. The longer and steeper ones I still just power hike up. Going down those quick steps really help to do two things get down quicker and give greater control over the descent.</p>
    <p><strong>Hills are speed work in disguise</strong></p>
    <p>One thing I seem to never forget about hill work has been that it helps me go faster on flatter sections. I could be wrong and I don't have any proof to back this up, but the quicker foot steps are is what really helps with the speed on the more even sections of the trails.</p>
