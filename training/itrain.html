          <h1>How I Train</h1>      
          <p>The way I train now has progressed from when I first started trail running. In the beginning I wasn't concerned with stretching nor working on my 'core'. Heck, I didn't even know I had a core. My how times have changed. I would encourage everyone no matter how young or old, new or veteran to trails to have some sort of stretching and strengthening routine.</p>
          <p>There are two areas of focus in my training these days. First is in keeping my legs flexible, second is in keeping my core strong. When I started hearing about the 'core' and working on it, I didn't think much of it until this story came to me. A friend of mine is a beast of a long distance road runner, running 24 hours around a high school track. Yes, this was a race. He was telling me that as he neared the end he couldn't keep his upper body upright. When I asked him why his reply was that his core wasn't strong enough to keep his body in the right form. His legs could kind of move, but nothing like when he could keep his trunk upright. Can you imagine trying to run while bent at a 90 degree angle? Yea, me either. So I started to work on my core.</p>
          <h2>Core Workout</h2>
          <p>I don't know if this is correct thinking on my part or not, but when I think of core I'm thinking of from my hips up to my shoulders. I'm aware that technically core is the stomach area and maybe the chess, but for me it is more. So the work I do for this area is clams, bridges, a variation of leg levers as well as a push up learned from Sally McRae. My variation of leg levers, I'm sure there is an name for it, is as your coming down just before you touch the floor you spread your feet as far apart as is comfortable, bring your feet back together then raise the legs again. I didn't start doing leg levers this way until I could manage 100 leg levers consistantly. I wanted a greater impact on my abs with less time than doing 100 leg levers and this has done the trick.</p>

          <p>Sally McRae has been a great person to follow on social media for inspiration and exercise ideas. My wife showed me a video of her doing a push up but with a couple of twists. First when your arms are extended you lift up one arm with a weight straight to your chess, then you go down and come back up and lift the other arm with a weight, then back down and up this time you cross one leg underneath towards the opposite shoulder then cross the other leg under you in the same manner; this would be considered one rep. She has a couple of other exercises up on her YouTube channel you can check out.</p>
          <h3>My Daily Workout</h3>
          <p>If your just starting out like I was a few years ago, you might not know what a 'bridge' is, so Google it there are plenty of videos out there. The key is to keep you glutes tight when you are in the up position. You might not believe this but that makes all the difference. Clams are easy enough to search and see how they are done, eventually you might want to get some resistance bands to increase the impact of the clams.</p>
          <p>Including the above exercises I have a full set/series that I go through these days. It takes me about 45 minutes each morning to do them; these I do Monday through Friday. Here is a brief list of what I do: squats, toe crunches - a must!, heal raises, calf stretches - both straight leg and bent leg, heal drops, hip rotations in which I'm bent over standing on one leg with the other out behind me, side steps with an exercise band, leg lunges, quad sets - for my knees. I also spend about 5 minutes with a stick called an Add-A-Day stick rolling my calf.</p>
          <p>Something else I've learned is that most of my issues come from overly tight calves and hamstrings. So ANYTHING I can do to keep them loose will pay off in huge ways.</p>

          <h3>My Cross Training</h3>
          <p>Believe it or not that is all I do in the mornings and it use to be all I ever did. Now I've added in some stationary bike riding. In training for SCAR I had put in 5 70+ mile weeks with a lot of climbing/vertical work. After that I wanted to keep my fitness up without spending all that time running on the trails. So I started riding a stationary bike. Depending on what I've got coming up I'll adjust what I do on the bike, but the basic idea is to not stop peddling for the entire time I'm on the bike. These sessions are anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours long. After a long run, any race or a run over 5 hours, I will get on the bike instead of running early in the week, Monday and Tuesday.</p>
          <h3>My Schedule</h3>
          <p> So with all this exercise you might wonder when I find time to run. My base run days are Tuesday, Thursday with a long run on Saturday or Sunday. When I'm focused on my A race for the year this have an added day of Wednesday and both days on the weekend. As my distances have gotten longer so have my training distances.</p>
          <p>When I started out I ran 3 days out of the week and the distances where all based upon the lenght of the race. The basics are that however long I was going to run on the weekend I would make sure I had that much time during the week. Yes, I trained to time not to miles and I still do. Then each weekend run would increase by 30 minutes for 3 weeks then on the 4th week I would drop back 2 weeks and build up again. Depending on how far off the race was I would plan this idea for 8 or 13 weeks of training. Following this idea I have never felt under prepared nor unable to finish the race. The last 50k I trained for I was doing my race distance 4 weeks into my training, so I decided to use the extra weeks to work on my speed.</p>
          <h3>Speed work</h3>
          <p>I often wonder how I can get faster on the trails without spending time on the road. Many of my friends spend a lot of time running on the road and tell me that it is the only way to get faster. Well... I don't really run on the road, nothing against road runners. So, what I've done has two parts. First is using the 'flatter' sections of trail, here I'll run as fast as I can for a period of time, like a minute or a bit longer, then slow down for about the same amount of time and if the trail is still 'flat' then sprint again followed by a slow down. The draw back here is that on trails you are almost always going up or down and flat can be very technical, which will slow me down. So, this type of speed work doesn't get done too often, especially as my distances have gotten longer.</p>
          <p>The second piece that helps with speed is hill work. My hill work is outlined <a href="/training/hills.html">here</a>. I was suprised with just how my over all speed picked up when I was only focusing on hills in my overall training.</p>
          <p><strong>Tapping Into Local Resources</strong> Early on I made aquaintances with a local PT shop through my local FleetFeet store. Both the FleetFeet and Results Physiotherapy have been incredable resources for how to do streching and strengthening correctly. I think it is important to keep a PT close by because you never know when their knowledge will come in handy.</p>
