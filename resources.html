        <h2>Nutrition</><br/>
          <p>I get asked questions about nutrition all the time. It is probably the second most frequent question I'm asked.<br />This last time it started this way "Hi everyone! I’m training for my first 25k. I’ve been reading up on fuel both before and during a long run." Their question was "What do you like to eat before a long trail run?"<br />So this is what I told them and everyone else "My biggest piece of advice is to try different things and see how your body responds. For my first couple of years I was carb focused at breakfast eating granola which I would top with extra nuts and seeds, which gave me some protein. Now, I'm eggs and sausage with some hash browns, which focuses on protein with a few carbs. I also use to eat the energys gels like GU, Hammer and whatever else. I had to stop becasue after about 4 of these my stomach would start hurting. Now I'm eating more real, whole, foods. I focus a lot on getting protein with some carbs while I run, this looks like Tanka Buffalo Jerky, Spring Energy, burrito bullets and oatmeal cookies from a local bakery.<br />While this is what works for me I really encourage you to try different things out and see what your body responds to the best. The best time to try things out is during your long runs at least a month before your race, this way you can make adjustments."</p><br />
