        <h2>Nutrition</><br/>
          <p>I get asked questions about nutrition all the time. It is probably the second most frequent question I'm asked. This last time it started this way "Hi everyone! Admitted newbie here - I’m training for my first 25k with the group. I’ve been reading up on fuel both before and during a long run and have a question that I think would benefit from being bounced around with other experienced runners." So this is what I told them and everyone else "My biggest piece of advice is to try different things and see how your body responds. For my first couple of years I was carb focused at breakfast getting protein from a lot of various nuts that I added into the cereal. Now I'm eggs and sausage with some hash browns. I've also switched from GU type gels while running to more real, whole, foods. I focus a lot on getting protein with some carbs while I run. While this is what works for me I really encourage you to try different things out and see what your body responds to the best. With a December race you have enough time to try different things and get it dialed in."</p><br />
