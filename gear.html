      <h3>Gear</h3>
      <h5>There is so much stuff you can buy, but not everything makes everyone a better trail runner.</h5>
    <div class="row-gear">
      <p>The basics are this shoes, hydration and clothing. I'm not even going to touch the clothing thing. My rain gear is a $5 white poncho and my shorts are military issue battle dress uniform (BDU) shorts. So to me wear what you want and what you like.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row-shoes">
      <p><strong>Shoes</strong>- My biggest piece of advice here is two-fold. First get fitted for shoes, just like you would a nice dress or suit do the same for your feet. I'm not talking about getting a custom made pair of shoes, but you walk in a certain way so get shoes that work with the way you walk. Get a pair of shoes similar to the foot wear you wear everyday. Most shoes have some sort of drop in height from the heal to the toes, it's called the heal-to-toe drop; get a trail shoe close to that drop. Now this doesn't work if your in heals all day or you wear cowboy boots all the time, yes I use to wear cowboy boots all the time. If that's the case then get a comfortable shoe with the highest heal-to-toe drop. Oh, and one more thing; we run through a lot of streams, creeks and narrow rivers we run over slick rocks. So find a shoe that is sticky, my personnal favorite as far as stick treads go is a Vibram sole. I have never worried about any slick rocks or water crossings in a Vibram soled shoe.<br/>There are a lot of different brands of trail shoes, the most noted are Nike, Solomon and Hoka One One and these brands are the ones I would recommend trying first.</p>

    <div class="row-hydration">
      <p><strong>Hydation</strong>- With hydration there are so many options. Many races require you to have some form of hydration that you will carry with you and for them even a dixie cup with a lid duck taped to your hand works. On the other end of the spectrum are hydration vests that you can use to carry just about anything you need. My biggest piece of advice here is to try different things out for your self. See if a store will let you return something because it doesn't work for you before you buy it. Think about these questions: Would you mind carrying a water bottle in your hand for a long period of time? Do you like carrying things in your hands or would you rather have your hands free? What might you need to carry with you? Is it small enough to fit into a running pocket? If yes, then do you really need a vest?<br/>Me personally I like the vest because I like having my hands free to grab anything.<br/>Once you have made that decision then there is the question of soft flasks or hard bottles?<strong>SO really</strong>, just try stuff out and see what works best for you.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="gear-stuff">
      <p><strong>Other Things</strong>- Treking Poles, micro spikes, water purifiers, watches, GPS devices, etc. You can really get geared out on stuff. The farther you get into trail running the more you'll be able to fine tune what you will use regularly as well as what you really don't need. I have all of the things listed at the beginning of this section and what I use the most is a tracking app on my phone and my poles. The spikes are for ice and the purifier is for my long adventure runs when I need to fill up with water again.</p>
