        <h2>Lookout Mountain 50 Mile Trail Race</h2>
        <div class="row text-left">
          <h4>2015 - This is my first year running a distance longer than 50k or 31ish miles.</h4><br/>
          
           This was a hard race for me. I had been told by a friend that I should be able to get it done in 8 1/2 hours maybe 9. I have been training hard, putting in the time out at Warner Parks as well as going out and finding a new and harder place to run than Warner Parks, a place called Frozen Head State Park. So I came into the race with what I thought was a reasonable time estimate. I should have known my friend who gave me the time estimate is known for telling folks faster times that what is reasonable.<br/>
It was a beautiful clear day, a bit chilly but the temps where expected to warm as the day went on. I had no idea on what to expect for the course, but thought I'd just give it my best shot and see what happened.<br/>
When I arrived for the start of the race I realized I had left most my food back at the hotel. So after a panicked conversation with my wife in which she was going to drive back to the hotel get my food and be back, hopefully, before I was with the rest of my food I lined up with everyone else. At the time I only knew two people runing the race were my friends Dan and Marla.<br/>
I thought the start running through the campus was going to kill me. I was trying to keep up with a group of people who were running so fast. I hit a little hill on the back side of some buildings and gratefully walked up it. Then a little drop down the road to a trail and we were off. This desent was marked with sheer rock walls on my right shoulder and huge drop offs on my left. I had some amazing views through the trees of the valley below, but I didn't look over too much because I was too worried about falling off the side of the mountain. There where a couple of times I tried to grab on to the side of the mountain as I'm going down because I was that worried about falling off. We passed under an incline railroad and then eventually popped out some sort of service road. From the road we ran up to the first aid station. As I approached this aid station I was heckled by some guys about my cargo shorts. I gave a quick quip back about it and rolled right through the aid station. I never saw them again. The next section was a mix of gentle and wide trails some of which was fire road and the rest single track. The approach to the next aid station was a gravel road. I stopped here to grab some food only to find out that they didn't have anything I was use to eating while on the trail, so I left. This began a climb back up to the starting area. About 3/4 of the way up I took out my poles after having moved through some sketchy sections were I again found myself clinging to the side of the mountain for fear of falling off. I survived the first half. As I was running back to the start finish I see my wife driving up. I arrive at the start/finish before her. Upon my arrival I see several friends there to help others that I know. My friends Jobie and Liz where both out here as well. Yong, Kevin and Teresa were a huge help in changing shirts, getting water and food and figuring out what I was going to need next. Yong ran to get my things from my wife as I tried to figure out what was happening. Kevin and Teresa took care of my vest stuff. Then Yong makes two statements I have not forgotten "You're not drinking enough water." as I was pointing to my electrolyte drink and then "We need to lighten you up. You're carrying too much stuff." and he took my poles from me and said we'll have them for you at some aid station later. I wasn't real sure but I trusted him and off I went after I kissed my wife.<br/>
The next section of trail was easy, rolling trail; it was a connector to another part of the mountain. I heard water long before I saw it. I dropped down on to a road next to a narrow river with a couple of good sized water falls. Here I found some food I would eat along with broth. After a quick refuel I was pointed down the trail where about a half mile later I found myself going up a rope climb. Once up I found myself on interstingly named trails like Middle Trail, Jedi, Turkey Trail, and Ovenbird Trail. At one point I was on what is called the Bluff Trail and it had the best views of the whole race! It was beautiful and I  exclaimed out loud to no, because I don't think anyone was around, "And this is why I do this." After a bit longer I pop out on this road and follow it to the next aid station.<br/>
Here I'm greeted my wife, Kevin and Teresa, but as I'm coming up the very steep drive I see Jobie. I have this very confused look on my face. I had no idea he would be there let a lone running it. Apprently he had something happen that didn't let him keep going. As we talked he talked me through the next section of trail, the lollipop of the course. He told me to treat the next 4 miles like it was 5 and to relax I was doing great. I don't know that he ever got just how much that meant to me. With the lolliepop done I kissed my wife back at the same aid station I had just left and kept going. She asked me if I wanted the poles and desided against them and off I went.<br/>
Going back at this point was easy because I knew what to expect, so I move really well back through this section of trail. When I arrived back at the aid station by the falls I was greeted with the chance to have a shot of burbon, which I took. That was rather nice and off I went. Again it was an easy roll back to the finish, but I was suprised again when Yong greeted me about 2 miles from the finish and ran me into the finish. I was so blessed to have him for those last 2 miles as he encouraged me and pushed me along. I made it back to the finish about 10:30 after I had started. I had gotten done just before it was fully dark, so I didn't need my head lamp. It was a great day and I got a red hoodie for finishing a long with my finishers medal and pint glass.</p>

        <h4>2016 - My second year running this fun race.</h4><br/>
          Two weeks before I had run The North Face 50 Mile Endurance Challenge in San Francisco. It had taken me over 12 hours to finish it. I wasn't sure how I was going to do at this race because I wasn't sure about my recovery. I had conversations with a couple of friends, Joel and Scott, about what I was attempting and what would they suggest I do to get ready for both. The basics of the advice was to keep moving, but don't over do anything; just hike and a real, real easy long run of about 10ish miles. So, I tried to do just that.<br/>
When it came time to toe the line I had learned that friends David and Shannon would be running the race as well and Shannon was going after her first 50 miler. I learned that Jobie was out here as well taking pictures, it was stacking up to be a great day. It was going to be a fun day. At the start I lost sight of both of them and went through some of my same rock face holding as I had done the year before. The course was the same so I knew what to expect, sort of, that meant I had to remember the trama I had put myself through the year before. By the end of the descent I had caught up to both of them and the heckling began. They stopped at the first aid station, I didn't. A little ways past the aid station I find a camera guy hiding behind a rock and a quick knuckle bump or high five and how ya doin' and I was off again. I made it around to the second aid station, looking but not stopping remembering that last year they didn't have anything for me. As I made my way back up David and Shannon passed me as I neared the top and I decided to pull out the poles for the last little bit, about a mile or two, of a sharp climb.<br/>
Once back at the start finish I didn't do any sort of gear change, it was cold and getting damp. I did take a few minutes longer than normal and had a couple cups of broth and noodles while chatting up the aid station team, then I moved on.<br/>
Knowing what to expect made a huge difference, but I hadn't planned very well. For the most part I moved really well all through the race, I was just going slow and enjoying myself. When I arrived at the water fall aid station I recognized Jobie's car and asked after him and discovered that he was down the trial somewhere. I found him as I climbed up the rope. All in all I ended up spending way to much time at all the second half aid stations talking with folks about anything and everything and eating. By the time I got back to the last aid station I learned that there was no burbon this year and that it was going to be dark by the time I got back to the start finish. I had burned too much time at aid stations this year. Well it was time to put the head lamp on and go get it done. I finished in 11:31, way longer than expected, but I was so excited to have this done. I had thought that if I could get two 50 milers done close together I was well on my way to being ready for my first 100 miler.</p>

            <h4>2017 - My third time running this race. It was not what I remembered.</h4><br/>
I had heard rumor that there had been a course change, so I started digging around trying to learn what the changes might be. With about 3 weeks to go before the race I hadn't been able to find anything about a change in the course. I was able to pace a friend on part of the course as they ran the Chattanooga 100 Miler, which was a good thing because I was able to remind myself of what that part of the course would be like and think about how I wanted to run that section. Like most plans they never survive the implementation phase without some adjustments.<br/>
When I finally learned about all the changes I didn't think it would be too big a deal, it seemed like most of the course was going to be on the same comfortable trails as before. So, I was looking forward to a nice run in the woods and planning on being done around my time from the first year. Yea, that didn't happen.<br/>
This years blow by blow.</br>
I have always divided this race into two parts, not really a true dividing in half but I refer to them as the first and second half.<br/>
I was looking forward to running with some great friends for the entire race David, Ryan and Shannon are always some fun friends and we like to heckle one another as we run. We never take the heckling seriously, the running/racing is another matter. I hung with most of them through the first 20 miles until around mile 14ish and we hit that last long climb and I dropped back slowing down on the climb knowing I was still making good time and that I would catch up to them, maybe. Between the two aid stations on this section was the first course change. Before we would have been moving around a small pond and then a small open meadow ending at the second aid station before starting a gentile climb back up to the college. Yea, that didn't happen; I should have realized right then and there I was running a totally different beast. Between the two aid stations we ran sections of fire road and single track, but parts of this new section included newly cut trail and power line switch back, sort of, climbing. The climb over all was shorter I believe, which made it steeper. Yea I had my poles out and going. I like using my poles as they help me move at a steady rate and help me regulate my breathing on climbs; I'm not bent over trying to breathe with constricted lungs.<br/>
The terrain through this first half. The decent was what I remembered and one of the things I was looking forward to, I knew I could cut some time here without a loss overall. Rocks, roots and ice were all on tap for this section and I needed quick feet to manage this section. Once 'down' for the most part was rolling fire road and single track until... As we got closer to the second aid station, the last one on the first half, the course change to a more rocky trail. The aid station was literally a truck pulled over on the side of a fire road. I grabbed two Spring Engery and kept on moving knowing that my friends who had stopped would be passing me all to soon. From this aid station back to the top I recognized some of the trail, but other parts not at all. I held off using the poles until I realized that it was getting steep and that I still had a long way to go to get back to the top. I had planned on 5 hours round trip from the start back to the start/finish which also tripled as aid station number 3; it took me 4ish hours to get back. So when I left I thought to myself 'Good you've banked an hour.' I didn't realize it at the time, but I was going to need that hour and more to get this race done.<br/>
I hit the aid station fast, I was in and out in under 5 minutes. I couldn't have gotten out that fast without a quicking thinking friend, Daryl, who jumped in while she was waiting on others to show up. Shirt and jacket change, grabbed two more Spring Energy and I was off.<br/>  
The second half started out with a root/rock reaching up and grabbing my left shoe about 2 or 3 miles from the start/finish aid station 3. Funny thing was when I looked back at the ground where it happened there was nothing there but the smallest of roots. In these 2 to 3 miles was another course change which had us almost running in a circle. Thankfully the section where I was tripped was very soft and peaty so I gently bounced as I rolled on my shoulder. After getting up and moving on I noticed that my knees were starting to act like they were not happy. By the time I was 3 miles from the last aid station I came to a sign that became the beginning of what was to become one of three serious course changes. I was expecting about an hour and a half to reach the next aid station, it took a bit over two hours. This new section was on the same section of trail that I had been on about two weeks prior pacing a friend. It was rolling, average drops and climbs of 50 feet every half mile or so. It was rocky with large rock surfaces of about 15 to 20 feet in length. It also doubled as a mountain bike trail so many of the switch backs were banked. In this section I could never get a rhythm going and it was in this section in which my hips started to join my knees at an attempted revolt. I was glad when I finally hit a section I knew. The Middle Trail was never such a welcomed site even though it was at this point all climb, it was open and a gental grade. As I passed old trail names I had been on in years past like Jedi, which always has me thinking of my wine making friend Kip, and Ovenbird and I think there was a Turkey trail. After that new section these where like old friends and I knew I was getting close to my next aid station.<br/>
When I hit this aid station I was greeted by an unexpected blessing, Yong was there, he was waiting to pace someone on their way back to the finish. Thanks to his help I was agian in and out in under 5 minutes. He put my poles away for me while I ate and grabbed two more Spring Energy. I was on my way and ready for what I thought would be very familar terrain up to the next aid station.<br/>
This next section of trail has the best view of the entire course and view wise is one of the reasons I keep going back, yea it's that great. It was easy rolling after a rope climb about a  1/2 mile from the aid station followed by a meandering climb through a mountain laurel thicket. By the time I hit the Bluff trail I was trying to run but my knees and hips had said 'No', so I resorted to my power hike mode with poles and moved in more of an interval fashion of run/walk. When I hit the road I was in a better mood than I had been because I knew where I was and that while the next aid station had been moved, it was close. Yea right, it wasn't. What was great was seeing Liz and Luke waiting for their friends to come through to be paced back to the finish. Luke helped me out by putting my poles back in my bag, which is where they stayed for the next mile, which was how far it was to the aid station. It was a bit demoralizing not to have had that aid station there, but Liz and Luke seeing Liz and Luke helped the mood greatly. By the time I made it to the next aid station I was more interval running than I would have liked.<br/>
When I pulled into the this aid station I was again blessed unexpectedly by Lauren who was waiting on Alicia to arrive. I was here a bit longer than expected due to some hydration blader issues. I knew I need to refill my bladder, so as Lauren took care of that I ate and as grabbed some Elec+roride. I noticed that the connection between my feeder tube and blader was leaking and quickly learned that when I clipped them together that morning I had lost the o-ring seal. So not wanting that water dripping down my back and making really cold I dumped all my water. At this point I knew my race had truely changed. It now became about finishing well and not beating any previous time, just getting it done.<br/>
I left the barn having had just a little food from the aid station, they were out of all but two Spring Energy so I relied on what I had with me. I was starting a four mile loop and coming back to the same spot. I looked at my watch and estimated my time back would be about an hour and 15 minutes later. I had been doing this the entire second half and up until this estimate I had been off by 15 to 30 minutes. This time I nailed it, which was both good and bad. Bad because I knew with where I was and how far I had to go I had nearly 4 more hours on course. It was good because I had a good handle on how long it was going to take and the terrain I was going to cover, or so I thought. The trail was part fresh cut and old course and it would have been great if I could have moved faster. It was a very enjoyable stretch around a pond and open woods. When I got back to the barn I was on track with my time and in better spirits than I had been having accepted my condition. After getting a bite of food and refilling with Elec+roride, they were now fully out of Spring Energy foods I started to move on. I did ask the folks working this station if I could use one of their horses to finish the race. Again I saw Lauren and now Kurt was with her and after a brief exchange about my condition I was off. I was here longer than 5 minutes, but less than 10. Time to move as fast as I could with as little stopping as possible. It was somewhere around 4pm when I left the barn and I was hoping to make the last aid station before dark because that meant I would be down the rope before dark. I was suprised to still see people coming as I got past the old aid station location, which also boosted my spirits. As bad off as I felt I wasn't going to be last. With a hearty farewell from Luke telling me "You got this" as I left the old aid station I was off. I told my self I had one Warner loop left and I could do this. A conversation along this section with someone else who had run this race before thought we got to go back the old way, which meant instead of 8 miles it would be 7 from the last aid station to the finish; that was great new, but it was so wrong.<br/>
I hit my last aid station in much the same fashion as I had been doing all day, in and out quick, eat get more Elec+roride poles put up just for a minute due to a quick rocky climb in which poles would have gotten in the way. I moved off as I was eating, broth and noodles in one hand and 1/2 a shot of burbon in the other. Just outside of this station I saw a friend who was having stomach issues. We chatted while they prepped to continue on and I finished my food and drink. I moved on and told them I expected them to catch up to me and we would finish together. About 30 minutes later I was in the dark, and about 45 minutes later I hit a road crossing in which they guys watching the road said I had a 10k left. To me that was great news as I said "Great, 3 miles to go." Then I thought some more and said "Oh that's 6 miles." At this point I knew I had about an hour and half left. At this point I'm on pure power hike mode only running a little. I get passed by a lot of folks, but I did manage to pass two who were moving slower than I was. This is when the section of trail that was almost a circle came back to bite hard. I had been moving well and was in a climb when I saw a building I knew to be apart of the college and I was thinking I'm so close! I've got less than a mile to go... Yea, no. I get to the top of the climb only to be turned away from the campus and back out into the woods. As I recalled the trail yet to be covered I realized I had about a mile and a half to go. Then as if to drive the knife in a bit deeper the trail pops out not an 1/8 of a mile from the finish, you can hear it and see the lights at the finish, only to be turned back into the woods for the last 3/4 of a mile. I'm greeted by a couple of guys as I'm passing someone "You're almost there, less than half a mile to go." I just dig my poles in and duck my head down and move as fast as I can. I see the Christmas lights showing the end of the race and I'm passed by a friend who is moving strong and I'm telling them to finish strong. I arrive back at the finish 12:16 after I started. I'm glad that's over.<br/>
One of the best things was right before I came in a friend had come in, but she was named after I was for some reason and then right after I came in I had two more friends finish; these three friends had just finished their first 50 mile race. I was and am so proud of them. I was glad I was able to share the finish with them.</p>
