        <h2>Lookout Mountain 50 Mile Trail Race</h2>
        <div class="row">
         <p>2015 - This is my first year running a distance longer than 50k or 31ish miles.</p>
        <p>2016 - My second year running this fun race.</p>
        <p>2017 - My third time running this race. It was not what I remembered.<br/>
I had heard rumor that there had been a course change, so I started digging around trying to learn what the changes might be. With about 3 weeks to go before the race I hadn't been able to find anything about a change in the course. I was able to pace a friend on part of the course as they ran the Chattanooga 100 Miler, which was a good thing because I was able to remind myself of what that part of the course would be like and think about how I wanted to run that section. Like most plans they never survive the implementation phase without some adjustments.<br/>
When I finally learned about all the changes I didn't think it would be too big a deal, it seemed like most of the course was going to be on the same comfortable trails as before. So, I was looking forward to a nice run in the woods and planning on being done around my time from the first year. Yea, that didn't happen.<br/>
This years blow by blow.</br>
I have always divided this race into two parts, not really a true dividing in half but I refer to them as the first and second half.<br/>
I was looking forward to running with some great friends for the entire race David, Ryan and Shannon are always some fun friends and we like to heckle one another as we run. We never take the heckling seriously, the running/racing is another matter. I hung with most of them through the first 20 miles until around mile 14ish and we hit that last long climb and I dropped back slowing down on the climb knowing I was still making good time and that I would catch up to them, maybe. Between the two aid stations on this section was the first course change. Before we would have been moving around a small pond and then a small open meadow ending at the second aid station before starting a gentile climb back up to the college. Yea, that didn't happen; I should have realized right then and there I was running a totally different beast. Between the two aid stations we ran sections of fire road and single track, but parts of this new section included newly cut trail and power line switch back, sort of, climbing. The climb over all was shorter I believe, which made it steeper. Yea I had my poles out and going. I like using my poles as they help me move at a steady rate and help me regulate my breathing on climbs; I'm not bent over trying to breathe with constricted lungs.<br/>
The terrain through this first half. The decent was what I remembered and one of the things I was looking forward to, I knew I could cut some time here without a loss overall. Rocks, roots and ice were all on tap for this section and I needed quick feet to manage this section. Once 'down' for the most part was rolling fire road and single track until... As we got closer to the second aid station, the last one on the first half, the course change to a more rocky trail. The aid station was literally a truck pulled over on the side of a fire road. I grabbed two Spring Engery and kept on moving knowing that my friends who had stopped would be passing me all to soon. From this aid station back to the top I recognized some of the trail, but other parts not at all. I held off using the poles until I realized that it was getting steep and that I still had a long way to go to get back to the top. I had planned on 5 hours round trip from the start back to the start/finish which also tripled as aid station number 3; it took me 4ish hours to get back. So when I left I thought to myself 'Good you've banked an hour.' I didn't realize it at the time, but I was going to need that hour and more to get this race done.<br/>
I hit the aid station fast, I was in and out in under 5 minutes. I couldn't have gotten out that fast without a quicking thinking friend, Daryl, who jumped in while she was waiting on others to show up. Shirt and jacket change, grabbed two more Spring Energy and I was off.<br/>  
The second half started out with a root/rock reaching up and grabbing my left shoe about 2 or 3 miles from the start/finish aid station 3. Funny thing was when I looked back at the ground where it happened there was nothing there but the smallest of roots. In these 2 to 3 miles was another course change which had us almost running in a circle. Thankfully the section where I was tripped was very soft and peaty so I gently bounced as I rolled on my shoulder. After getting up and moving on I noticed that my knees were starting to act like they were not happy. By the time I was 3 miles from the last aid station I came to a sign that became the beginning of what was to become one of three serious course changes. I was expecting about an hour and a half to reach the next aid station, it took a bit over two hours. This new section was on the same section of trail that I had been on about two weeks prior pacing a friend. It was rolling, average drops and climbs of 50 feet every half mile or so. It was rocky with large rock surfaces of about 15 to 20 feet in length. It also doubled as a mountain bike trail so many of the switch backs were banked. In this section I could never get a rhythm going and it was in this section in which my hips started to join my knees at an attempted revolt. I was glad when I finally hit a section I knew. The Middle Trail was never such a welcomed site even though it was at this point all climb, it was open and a gental grade. As I passed old trail names I had been on in years past like Jedi, which always has me thinking of my wine making friend Kip, and Ovenbird and I think there was a Turkey trail. After that new section these where like old friends and I knew I was getting close to my next aid station.<br/>
When I hit this aid station I was greeted by an unexpected blessing, Yong was there, he was waiting to pace someone on their way back to the finish. Thanks to his help I was agian in and out in under 5 minutes. He put my poles away for me while I ate and grabbed two more Spring Energy. I was on my way and ready for what I thought would be very familar terrain up to the next aid station.<br/>
This next section of trail has the best view of the entire course and view wise is one of the reasons I keep going back, yea it's that great. It was easy rolling after a rope climb about a  1/2 mile from the aid station followed by a meandering climb through a mountain laurel thicket. By the time I hit the Bluff trail I was trying to run but my knees and hips had said 'No', so I resorted to my power hike mode with poles and moved in more of an interval fashion of run/walk. When I hit the road I was in a better mood than I had been because I knew where I was and that while the next aid station had been moved, it was close. Yea right, it wasn't. What was great was seeing Liz and Luke waiting for their friends to come through to be paced back to the finish. Luke helped me out by putting my poles back in my bag, which is where they stayed for the next mile, which was how far it was to the aid station. It was a bit demoralizing not to have had that aid station there, but Liz and Luke seeing Liz and Luke helped the mood greatly. By the time I made it to the next aid station I was more interval running than I would have liked.<br/>
When I pulled into the this aid station I was again blessed unexpectedly by Lauren who was waiting on Alicia to arrive. I was here a bit longer than expected due to some hydration blader issues. I knew I need to refill my bladder, so as Lauren took care of that I ate and as grabbed some Elec+roride. I noticed that the connection between my feeder tube and blader was leaking and quickly learned that when I clipped them together that morning I had lost the o-ring seal. So not wanting that water dripping down my back and making really cold I dumped all my water. At this point I knew my race had truely changed. It now became about finishing well and not beating any previous time, just getting it done.<br/>
I left the barn having had just a little food from the aid station, they were out of all but two Spring Energy so I relied on what I had with me. I was starting a four mile loop and coming back to the same spot. I looked at my watch and estimated my time back would be about an hour and 15 minutes later. I had been doing this the entire second half and up until this estimate I had been off by 15 to 30 minutes. This time I nailed it, which was both good and bad. Bad because I knew with where I was and how far I had to go I had nearly 4 more hours on course. It was good because I had a good handle on how long it was going to take and the terrain I was going to cover, or so I thought. The trail was part fresh cut and old course and it would have been great if I could have moved faster. It was a very enjoyable stretch around a pond and open woods. When I got back to the barn I was on track with my time and in better spirits than I had been having accepted my condition. After getting a bite of food and refilling with Elec+roride, they were now fully out of Spring Energy foods I started to move on. I did ask the folks working this station if I could use one of their horses to finish the race. Again I saw Lauren and now Kurt was with her and after a brief exchange about my condition I was off. I was here longer than 5 minutes, but less than 10. Time to move as fast as I could with as little stopping as possible. It was somewhere around 4pm when I left the barn and I was hoping to make the last aid station before dark because that meant I would be down the rope before dark. I was suprised to still see people coming as I got past the old aid station location, which also boosted my spirits. As bad off as I felt I wasn't going to be last. With a hearty farewell from Luke telling me "You got this" as I left the old aid station I was off. I told my self I had one Warner loop left and I could do this. A conversation along this section with someone else who had run this race before thought we got to go back the old way, which meant instead of 8 miles it would be 7 from the last aid station to the finish; that was great new, but it was so wrong.<br/>
I hit my last aid station in much the same fashion as I had been doing all day, in and out quick, eat get more Elec+roride poles put up just for a minute due to a quick rocky climb in which poles would have gotten in the way. I moved off as I was eating, broth and noodles in one hand and 1/2 a shot of burbon in the other. Just outside of this station I saw a friend who was having stomach issues. We chatted while they prepped to continue on and I finished my food and drink. I moved on and told them I expected them to catch up to me and we would finish together. About 30 minutes later I was in the dark, and about 45 minutes later I hit a road crossing in which they guys watching the road said I had a 10k left. To me that was great news as I said "Great, 3 miles to go." Then I thought some more and said "Oh that's 6 miles." At this point I knew I had about an hour and half left. At this point I'm on pure power hike mode only running a little. I get passed by a lot of folks, but I did manage to pass two who were moving slower than I was. This is when the section of trail that was almost a circle came back to bite hard. I had been moving well and was in a climb when I saw a building I knew to be apart of the college and I was thinking I'm so close! I've got less than a mile to go... Yea, no. I get to the top of the climb only to be turned away from the campus and back out into the woods. As I recalled the trail yet to be covered I realized I had about a mile and a half to go. Then as if to drive the knife in a bit deeper the trail pops out not an 1/8 of a mile from the finish, you can hear it and see the lights at the finish, only to be turned back into the woods for the last 3/4 of a mile. I'm greeted by a couple of guys as I'm passing someone "You're almost there, less than half a mile to go." I just dig my poles in and duck my head down and move as fast as I can. I see the Christmas lights showing the end of the race and I'm passed by a friend who is moving strong and I'm telling them to finish strong. I arrive back at the finish 12:16 after I started. I'm glad that's over.<br/>
One of the best things was right before I came in a friend had come in, but she was named after I was for some reason and then right after I came in I had two more friends finish; these three friends had just finished their first 50 mile race. I was and am so proud of them. I was glad I was able to share the finish with them.</p>
